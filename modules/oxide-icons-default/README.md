# Default icons for HugeRTE

This project contains the default icons for HugeRTE 7. Icons is loaded into the editor using a icon pack file. You can use this project as a basis for building your own icon packs. For instructions on how to make your own icon pack, see the [HugeRTE 7 documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/hugerte/7/creating-an-icon-pack/)

## Building the icon pack
The icon pack build process uses [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Make sure you have both installed before you continue.

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Build the icon pack using the `yarn run build` command.
